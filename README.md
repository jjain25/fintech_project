Project Title
Portfolio Optimization with VaR and CVaR Models

Project Description
Provide an overview of the project:

Explain the goal of portfolio optimization and the role of VaR (Value at Risk) and CVaR (Conditional Value at Risk) in assessing financial risk.
Mention any real-world implications or use cases, such as investment strategy optimization.
Features and Objectives
Outline the main features or goals of the project:

Developing a model to optimize a portfolio of assets.
Integrating risk assessment using VaR and CVaR methodologies.
Improving risk-adjusted returns for given portfolios.
Methodology
Include technical details on the steps involved:

Data Collection: Mention sources of financial data, e.g., historical prices or returns data.
Modeling: Briefly explain the optimization model and algorithms used.
Risk Measurement: Describe how VaR and CVaR are calculated and applied within the portfolio.
Technologies and Tools
List technologies and tools used:

Programming Languages: Python
Libraries: numpy, pandas, scipy, yfinance, MinMax scalar,
Discuss how the model's success or accuracy was evaluated, and summarize any notable findings.
