1.Project Title
"Portfolio Optimization and VaR and CVaR"

2.Introduction
Provide an overview of portfolio optimization, focusing on its importance in financial risk management. Briefly explain VaR (Value at Risk) and CVaR (Conditional Value at Risk) as methods used to quantify risk.
3.Objective
Describe the projectâ€™s purpose, such as developing a model that optimizes asset allocation while managing financial risk, using VaR and CVaR for risk analysis.
4.Features
Key features of the project, like:
Asset allocation and risk measurement.
Implementation of VaR and CVaR for risk assessment.
Analysis of trade-offs between risk and return.

5.Technologies Used
List technologies and libraries: Python, NumPy, Pandas, SciPy, plotly, yfinance, maptplot,
6.Data
Taken the data from the Yahoo Finance (yfiance library)
7..Methodology
Explain your approach:
Steps taken for data preprocessing.
Calculations of VaR and CVaR.
Optimization techniques for asset allocation (e.g., mean-variance optimization, minimizing CVaR).

8.Usage
Instructions for setting up and running the project.
Code snippets and examples if applicable.
9.Results
Summarize key findings, such as insights on risk management using VaR and CVaR and performance metrics.
Conclusion

Discuss the implications of the project and potential real-world applications.
